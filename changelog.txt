2.5 - 2005/02/05

 Cosmetic:
 1. "Now Playing" displays an album cover if available
    (also updated the now playing to a partial include)

    this caused it to return a bad result (silly typos!)

    (simply makes more sense now)

 Legal:
 1. All code is now under the MIT license, meaning
    you can do whatever the hell you feel like
    doing with this code.

 Cosmetic:

    page

 Cosmetic:
 1. Updated design, overhauled everything.

    efficiency is better, code cleanliness is yummy

1.0 - 2004/01/03

 General:
 1. Hacked code together from original templates
    not very efficient, suggest new system later.

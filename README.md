# Listbotto

A PHP Backend/Frontend to SAM Broadcaster written for NSRadio

## Requirements

[SAM Broadcaster](http://www.spacialaudio.com/?page=sam-broadcaster)
Webserver (Apache, Nginx, etc) with PHP 4 or later installed
MySQL Database (This should already be setup by SAM)

## Installation

Install at your own risk, this code was last touched back in 2005.

I would suggest starting @ global.php for configuration options.

## Background

Listbotto was the code name for a jukebox that would take requests and play music
when the NSRadio DJs were not on the air.  I've kept this code since NSRadio broke up
and recently re-discovered it, keeping it up on github for code examples.
